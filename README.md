##About

A personal C++ research project into 2D game engine development, circa 2009.

##Background

Completing this project really helped me embrace object-oriented design principles. I had always been a champion of OOD, but this really struck it home for me. I also got accustomed to creating and using manager-type classes, like a screen manager to handle screen composition and an entity manager to handle the updates and rendering of all in-game entities. It was a very rewarding exercise.

I can't take all the credit however. There was a tutorial I found online that helped me navigate through many coding hurdles and conceptual design choices, but, for the life of me, I can't find it online anymore.

In order for this project to build, you'll need to download Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) at https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php and SDL Image at https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release-1.2.html. Add the "/include" and "/lib" folders from both of these libraries to the project's _Additional Include Directories_ and _Additional Library Directories_ settings in Visual Studio, respectively.
